# kfreestyle2d
Unofficial Kinesis Freestyle 2 Userspace Linux Driver

## Build
`make`

## Run
The driver expects to be given the path to an HID raw input device
that corresponds to the special function keys of a Kinesis Freestyle 2.

To find the correct HID raw input device, unplug your keyboard and
`ls /dev/hidraw*`. Then plug it in and `ls /dev/hidraw*`.

There should be two new `/dev/hidrawX` files the second time.

Try `sudo head -c 1 /dev/hidrawA` where A is the first new raw input file.
Then type on your keyboard. If the command exits, it just read normal keyboard
input from that file, which means that it is **not** the special function key
raw input file. If the command does not exit, try typing one of the special
keys (mute, volumedown, volumeup, calculator). Remember to press the function
key before trying to use these. If the command exits when you type a special
key, this is the file you're looking for.

To start the driver, run:
`sudo ./kfreestyle2d /dev/hidrawX` where X is the number of the raw input device
for the special keys.

When the driver is running, it should create a new `/dev/input/eventXX` file,
where XX is some number with 1-3 digits. You can run `sudo evtest /dev/input/eventXX`
on that file to see the output generated by the driver when you press those keys.

If the driver isn't generating output, feel free to create an issue.

If it is, you should now be able to configure your programs to handle these
keys using ordinary X or Wayland key configuration.
